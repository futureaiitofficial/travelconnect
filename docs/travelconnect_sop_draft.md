**Purpose Document: Travel Connect - A Social Media Platform for Travelers**

---

**1. Introduction & Vision:**
Travel Connect is a comprehensive social media and trip collaboration platform developed for global travelers. The platform enables users to share experiences, discover destinations, plan trips collaboratively, and connect in real-time with fellow travelers. It combines traditional social networking with specialized travel planning tools, built with a focus on scalability, real-time interaction, intuitive UI/UX, and mobile responsiveness.

---

**2. Detailed Objectives:**
- Create a space where travelers can share visual stories with location-aware media.
- Enable travelers to follow each other, message privately or in groups, and plan trips together.
- Provide tools like travel maps, itinerary builders, and checklists for collaborative trip planning.
- Offer real-time updates and notifications to keep users engaged.
- Deliver an admin control layer for content moderation, analytics, and community management.

**3. Platform Architecture:**

**Frontend (Angular):**
- Angular CLI project with SCSS styling and Angular Material
- Fully component-based, standalone components without NgModules
- Uses Angular Signals for state, `computed()` for derived state
- Control flow via `@if`, `@for`, `@switch` (avoids structural directives)
- JWT stored in memory/localStorage, fetched using interceptors
- Lazy-loaded feature modules (e.g., /feed, /profile, /chat, /trip-planner)

**Backend (Node.js + Express):**
- RESTful APIs organized by resource (auth, users, posts, trips, etc.)
- Uses Express middlewares for logging, error handling, and JWT auth
- Socket.IO setup for real-time chat and notification services

**Database (MongoDB):**
- Mongoose ODM for schema definition and querying
- Collections: users, posts, comments, messages, conversations, trips, notifications, hashtags, locations, reports
- Indexing:
  - Geospatial: for nearby posts, visited places
  - Text: for search on captions, bios, hashtags
  - Compound: e.g., (userId, createdAt) in posts
